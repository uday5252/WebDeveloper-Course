You are creating a basic online quiz application. Users can select answers to multiple-choice questions, submit their answers, and see their score. Implement this using JavaScript and DOM manipulation.

*Project Question:*
Build a simple online quiz application with the following features:
1. Create a set of multiple-choice questions with at least five questions.
2. Display one question at a time to the user, along with multiple-choice options.
3. Users can select one option as their answer for each question.
4. Provide a "Next" button to move to the next question after selecting an answer.
5. After answering all questions, calculate and display the user's score (the number of correct answers out of total questions).
6. Allow users to retake the quiz or start over.
